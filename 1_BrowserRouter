React Routing-
______________________________________

React Router is a popular library for handling navigation and routing in React applications. It enables the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) by dynamically rendering components based on the URL without a full page reload.

npm install react-router-dom

Basic Routing-


<BrowserRouter>: Enables routing using the browser's history API.
<Routes>: A wrapper for defining multiple <Route> components.
<Route>: Defines a route where path is the URL and element is the component to render.


import React from "react"; 
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom"; 

const Home = () => <h1>Home Page</h1>;

 const About = () => <h1>About Page</h1>;

 const App = () => { 
    return ( 
<Router>
 <Routes>
 <Route path="/" element={<Home />} /> 
<Route path="/about" element={<About />} /> 
</Routes>
 </Router> ); }; 
export default App;


__________


Instead of <a> tags (which cause a full-page reload), React Router provides <Link> and <NavLink> for navigation.


Link -

import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
 const Navbar = () => { 
return ( 
<nav>
â€˜ <Link to="/">Home</Link>
 <Link to="/about">About</Link> 
</nav> ); };

Difference between Link
-


<Link>: Used for navigation.
<NavLink>: Works like <Link> but also applies an active class to the current route.

For Navlink-


<NavLink to="/about" activeClassName="active">About</NavLink>
